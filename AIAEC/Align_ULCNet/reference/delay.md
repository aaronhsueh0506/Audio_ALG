# Streaming delay-profile sweep

`sweep_delay_depth.py` runs the same checkpoint through the real
`forward_stream()` path at several fixed delay depths.  The PBFDKF frontend
and STFT inputs are computed once, so the resulting WAV differences come only
from D.  Each run writes a float WAV, a frame-by-frame delay trace, the AEC
alignment trace, and one row in `summary.csv` containing the resolved delay
profile, state RAM, Python RTF, boundary-hit rate, and the waveform difference
from the checkpoint's D:

```bash
python3 sweep_delay_depth.py checkpoint.pth mic.wav far.wav d_sweep \
  --depths 64,32,16,8,4 --device cuda
```

A delay profile has two independent halves and the tool drives both:

| knob | flag | fixed at | governs |
|---|---|---|---|
| matched-filter bank size `n` | `--delay-num-filters` | AEC init | how far the bulk far-to-mic delay search reaches, and AEC pool |
| alignment depth `D` | `--depths` | ONNX export | how many past 16 ms frames the attention keeps, and model state |

They are not one delay budget: each layer only has to satisfy the input
condition the previous one delivers, which is why both appear in every summary
row instead of being summed.  Reliable reach of the bank is 125 / 221 / 317 /
413 / 509 ms for `n` = 1..5.

`--delay-num-filters` is a **runtime AEC init override** for the deployment or
diagnostic frontend. It is not a checkpoint-compatibility or retraining
requirement:
dataset generation remains frozen at `n = 5`, while a product may choose a
smaller n when its measured bulk-delay range plus acquisition margin fits that
bank. Omitting the flag reproduces the dataset-generation frontend. The bank
size recorded in `summary.csv` is read back from the constructed engine, so a
row cannot name a profile the run did not actually execute.

The normal streaming inference CLI exposes the same deployment override:

```bash
python3 inference.py checkpoint.pth mic.wav far.wav out.wav \
  --delay-num-filters 2
```

The default remains `n = 5`. The flag is rejected together with
`--input-is-linear-error`, because that mode bypasses PBFDKF and therefore has
no matched-filter bank to resize.

The matched-filter bank and the NN far input are independent. To reproduce the
checkpoint's training provenance while retaining PBFDKF delay estimation for
the linear-error input, run:

```bash
python3 inference.py checkpoint.pth mic.wav far.wav out.wav \
  --delay-num-filters 5 --far-input-mode raw_far
```

`raw_far` changes only the NN branch; PBFDKF still runs with `n = 5` and
produces `linear_error`. It is the training and deployment default.
`aligned_far` remains available only as an explicit diagnostic comparison.

```bash
# short-route candidate: smaller bank, aligned far, shallow attention
python3 sweep_delay_depth.py checkpoint.pth mic.wav far.wav short_route \
  --far-input-mode aligned_far --delay-num-filters 2 --depths 8,4
```

For a published or external KF residual, add `--input-is-linear-error` (it
bypasses PBFDKF entirely, so it cannot be combined with a bank-size override).
An aligned clean reference may be supplied with `--target-wav` to add SNR and
SI-SDR columns.  To test the proposed small-D deployment seam, add
`--far-input-mode aligned_far`; the tool then feeds the NN the post-delay-
buffer far samples that PBFDKF actually consumed.  In
`--input-is-linear-error` bypass mode it cannot recover that internal tap, so
the supplied far WAV is explicitly assumed to be pre-aligned.

Every clip is QA'd against an **estimator-independent** offline measurement of
the bulk delay: a windowed, energy-gated, normalized cross-correlation of the
raw far against the raw mic.  The applied delay must land at, or just before,
that measurement.  A clip that fails is reported as `mislock` and marked
invalid (`qa_valid` in `summary.csv`) so it cannot be averaged into a
delay-profile statistic. A delay outside the selected bank's reliable range
that stays unlocked is reported as valid `not_acquired`; failure to acquire a
decidable in-range delay is `not_acquired_in_range` and invalid.

The Python RTF is only a relative D comparison on the same machine; it does
not predict NPU runtime.  Compare the boundary rates/probability with the
uninformative softmax baseline `1/D`: a boundary value near that baseline may
only mean that attention is diffuse, whereas a trained head repeatedly
concentrating at the oldest slot suggests D is too small.  Listen to every
generated WAV and validate task metrics before fixing D in an ONNX export.
